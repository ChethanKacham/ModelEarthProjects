# Location Projects for Open WebUI

GETTING STARTED

If you're contributing code, use our [Install for Building Locally](setup) steps.  
To build locally, you'll skip the local Docker install. Fork our [projects](https://github.com/ModelEarth/projects/) repo, which is a fork of open-webui.  

If you're NOT building code, use the [local Docker install](setup/docker).
This [Open WebUI video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-aRJe--txs) walks through downloading Ollama and Docker like we've documented on the local.

## Contribute in our Open WebUI "projects/location" folder

The "projects/location" folder is we add extras - but we don't have a build process yet.  
If you're making updates in the "src" and "backend" folders, 
prepend "team-" to files copied and customized to avoid merge errors.

TO DO: The html we added in this "projects" fork is breaking the GitHub Docker build.  
Try simple edits in our [open-webui-earthscape](https://github.com/earthscape/open-webui-earthscape) fork. (Write loren to be added as a contributor.)
